# Nashville-Case-Study

A Case Study on analyzing the distribution of building permits in Nashville with Geospatial Data.

This project aims to communicate the densities of building permits within each council district of Nashville.

## Source

The data used in this case study was downloaded from the [Nashville Open data website](https://data.nashville.gov/).

## Findings

From the visualisation generated at the end of the notebook, we can conclude that a greater number of building permits is issued to the council districts at the centre of the state with lesser being issued to the others.

## P.S

The final visualization is interactive so feel free to mess around with it to your heart's content. I had a lot of fun working on this project!
